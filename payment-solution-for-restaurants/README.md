# Payment solution for restaurants

You work for a company that builds software for restaurants, to help the customers pay for their meals.

## Goals and deliverables

The goal is to build a payment solution for restaurants that allows customers to pay for their meal once they have
finished eating. Using their mobile, they can scan a QR code on the restaurant table, and be redirected to a web

any part of the problem and solution you think are relevant.

You are encouraged to deliver comprehensive diagrams and any other relevant artifacts that illustrate your approach.
